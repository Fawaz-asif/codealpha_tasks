This are the tasks for Code Alpha Internship, July batch, for python development.



TASK 1: Hangman Game 
Goal: Create a simple text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time. 
Simplified Scope: 
● Use a small list of 5 predefined words (no need to use a file or API). 
● Limit incorrect guesses to 6. 
● Basic console input/output — no graphics or audio. 
Key Concepts Used: random, while loop, if-else, strings, lists.



TASK 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker 
● Goal: Build a simple stock tracker that calculates total investment based on manually defined stock 
prices. 
● Simplified Scope: 
○ User inputs stock names and quantity. 
○ Use a hardcoded dictionary to define stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250}). 
○ Display total investment value and optionally save the result in a .txt or .csv file. 
● Key Concepts Used: dictionary, input/output, basic arithmetic, file handling 
(optional).
